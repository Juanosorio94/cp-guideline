# Competitive programming guideline


## About
This is another guide about the basic topics in competitive programming,
the main goal in this project is to be a reference for students at UTP.

## Meetings
There are weekly meetings at (PUT ROOM HERE), feel free to assist there
and make questions, solve problems and have fun (:

We encourage everyone to take part of this project, 
even if you don't like the competitive programming. 
There are really amazing topics to learn about.

## The plan
We aim to talk about the following topics through the semester. (In that order).
